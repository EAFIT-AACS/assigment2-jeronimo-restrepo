System and Tools

Operating System: Windows 11.

Programming Language: Java 21

Development Tools: Visual Studio Code
Running the Implementation

Ensure Java is Installed

Check Java version:

java -version

If Java is not installed, download and install it from Oracle JDK or use OpenJDK.

Clone the Repository

git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>

Compile the Java Files

javac Main.java ALGORITHM_1_LFCO_2025_JRC.java ALGORITHM_2_LFCO_2025_JRC.java ALGORITHM_3_LFCO_2025_JRC.java

Run the Program

java Main

Expected Output

The program will generate valid and invalid strings.

It will check if they belong to the grammar.

If valid, it will construct and print the derivation tree.


ALGORITHM_1_LFCO_2025_JRC: Generates valid and invalid strings based on the given grammar. Valid strings follow the structure aSb.

ALGORITHM_2_LFCO_2025_JRC: Recognizes whether a string belongs to the language defined by the grammar. It uses a stack to ensure that each ‘a’ has a corresponding ‘b’.

ALGORITHM_3_LFCO_2025_JRC: Constructs the derivation tree for a valid string, showing step by step the transformation from the initial form to the complete derivation.

Advices:

Ensure all .java files are in the same directory.

Modify <repository-url> and <repository-folder> according to your setup.

If using an IDE, import the project and run Main.java directly.
